    <b>Co</b>mputational <b>Phy(&#8709)</b>siology research team is embedded
    within the Department of Thermal and Fluid Engineering at the University of
    Twente.
    We develop numerical methods and computational tools to understand
    physiological flows and processes.
    </p>

    <p>I am an Associate Professor of Biofluid Dynamics at the University of
    Twente.
    I am interested in understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of
    several diseases through numerical simulations on large scale computational
    resources. 
    After obtaining a bachelors of Control engineering in India, I worked as a
    software developer for some time in India.
    After that I moved to the RWTH Aachen University in Germany where I
    acquired my masters degree in mechanical engineering with a specialisation
    in Simulation Sciences.
    During my master studies I worked as a student assistant in the laboratory
    of <a href="https://www.dlr.de/en/sp/about-us/institute">Prof. Sabine
    Roller</a>
    and completed my master thesis in the direction of thrombosis modeling
    using Lattice Boltzmann methods.
    Upon completion of my masters I moved with Prof. Roller to work as a
    researcher at the University of Siegen in Germany and obtained a doctoral
    degree (Dr.-Ing.) with <i>summa cum laude</i> under her supervision.
    During my PhD studies I collaborated closely with  
    <a href="https://kent-and.github.io/index.html">Prof.  Kent-Andre
    Mardal</a> and published several articles with him.
    My <a href
    ="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309115983_Transition_to_Turbulence_in_Physiological_Flows_Direct_Numerical_Simulation_of_Hemodynamics_in_Intracranial_Aneurysms_and_Cerebrospinal_Fluid_Hydrodynamics_in_the_Spinal_Canal">
    doctoral dissertation</a> explored and characterized transition to
    turbulence in biofluid applications like blood flow in intracranial
    aneurysms and cerebrospinal fluid flow in the spinal canal.  
    My work explored characteristics of transition to turbulence with steady,
    pulsatile and oscillatory flow in canonical stenosed pipes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    After completing my doctorate, I accepted an offer to work as a Postdoc at
    the Institute of Physiology of the University of Z&uumlrich, Switzerland
    under the supervision of 
    <a href="https://interfacegroup.ch/member/vartan-kurtcuoglu/"> Prof.
    Vartan Kurtcuoglu</a>. 
    There my research focused on computational modeling of renal hemodynamics
    and renal hypoxia within the Swiss national center of competence in
    research <a
    href="https://www.snf.ch/en/hUY0aMdJu6Y8EnrU/page/researchinFocus/nccr/nccr-kidney-ch">
    NCCR Kidney.CH</a>.
    After two years of postdoc, I returned to Germany to work as a senior
    scientist at the Institute for Computational Physics of the University of
    Stuttgart with 
    <a href="https://www.icp.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/team/Holm-00005/">
    Prof.  Christian Holm</a>. 

    In Stuttgart my research focused on the modeling of bacterial dynamics and
    biofilm lifecycle in confined geometries within the DFG collaborative
    research center <a href="https://www.sfb1313.uni-stuttgart.de">
    SFB1313</a>.</p>
