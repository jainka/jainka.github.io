    <h2>Computational Physiology Research at Twente</h2>
    <p>
      <mark> A PhD position is available in my group to study
      the basic mechanisms behind Type II Endoleaks in abdominal aortic
      aneurysms. 
      The candidate will develop algorithms in the LBM solver Musubi and
      collaborate with clinical and industrial partners.
      Please contact me for further details.</mark>

    <p>
    <b>Co</b>mputational <b>Phy(&#8709)</b>siology research group at the
    University of Twente is embedded within the Engineering Fluid Dynamics (EFD)
    chair.
    The <b>Co&#8709</b> group develops computational models of various
    physiologic problems, in particular various types of physiologic flows.
    </p>

    <p>I am Assistant Professor of Biofluid Dynamics at the University of
    Twente.
    I lead the activities within the <b>Co&#8709</b> team, and am working on
    the growth of research in this direction.
    After my bachelors in Control engineering in India, I worked as a software
    developer for some time in India.
    After that I moved to the RWTH Aachen University in Germany where I
    acquired my masters degree in mechanical engineering with a specialisation
    in Simulation Sciences.
    During my master studies I worked as a student assistant in the laboratory of
    <a href="https://www.mb.uni-siegen.de/sts/team/sabine_roller/">Prof.
    Sabine Roller</a>
    and wrote my master thesis in the direction of thrombosis modeling using
    Lattice Boltzmann methods.
    Upon completion of my masters I moved with Prof. Roller to work as a
    researcher at the University of Siegen in Germany and obtained a doctoral
    degree (Dr.-Ing.) under her supervision.
    During my PhD studies I collaborated closely with  
    <a href="https://kent-and.github.io/index.html">Prof.  Kent-Andre
    Mardal</a> and published several articles with him.
    My <a href
    ="https://www.simula.no/sites/default/files/publications/files/jain_dissertation.compressed.pdf">
    doctoral dissertation</a> explored and characterized transition to
    turbulence in biofluid applications like blood flow in intracranial
    aneurysms and cerebrospinal fluid flow in the spinal canal.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    After I got my Dr.-Ing. degree I accepted the offer to work as a Postdoc at
    the Institute of Physiology of the University of Z&uumlrich, Switzerland,
    where my research focused on computational modeling of renal hemodynamics
    and renal hypoxia within the Swiss national center of competence in
    research <a href="https://nccr-kidney.ch"> NCCR Kidney.CH</a>.
    After two years of postdoc I returned to Germany to work as a senior
    scientist at the Institute for Computational Physics of the University of
    Stuttgart with <a
    href="https://www2.icp.uni-stuttgart.de/~icp/Christian_Holm"> Prof.
    Christian Holm</a>. 

    In Stuttgart my research focused on the modeling of bacterial dynamics and
    biofilm lifecycle in confined geometries within the DFG collaborative
    research center <a href="https://www.sfb1313.uni-stuttgart.de">
    SFB1313</a>.</p>
