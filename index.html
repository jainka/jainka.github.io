    <h2>Computational Physiology Research at Twente</h2>
    <p>
    <b>Co</b>mputational <b>Phy(&#8709)</b>siology research group at the
    University of Twente is embedded within the Engineering Fluid Dynamics (EFD)
    chair.
    The <b>Co&#8709</b> group develops computational models of various
    physiologic problems, in particular various types of physiologic flows.
    </p>

    <p>The group is led by Kartik Jain, an Assistant Professor of Biofluid
    Dynamics at the Engineering Fluid Dynamics group of the University of
    Twente.
    Kartik obtained a Doctoral degree in Mechanical Engineering (Dr.-Ing.) with
    a distinction (summa cum laude) from the University of Siegen in Germany,
    prior to which he acquired his masters in Mechanical Engineering with a
    specialisation in Simulation Sciences from the RWTH Aachen University,
    Germany.
    His <a href
    ="https://www.simula.no/sites/default/files/publications/files/jain_dissertation.compressed.pdf">
    doctoral dissertation</a> explored and characterized transition to
    turbulence in biofluid applications like blood flow in intracranial
    aneurysms and cerebrospinal fluid flow in the spinal canal.  Before moving
    to Europe, he acquired a Bachelor degree in Control Engineering from
    Kurukshetra University, India and then worked as a software developer in a
    leading IT company.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    After completion of his PhD he spent two years as a Postdoc at the
    Institute of Physiology of the University of Z&uumlrich, Switzerland, where
    his research focused on computational modeling of renal hemodynamics and
    renal hypoxia within the Swiss national center of competence in research
    <a href="https://nccr-kidney.ch"> NCCR Kidney.CH</a>.
    He thereafter returned to Germany to work as a senior scientist at the
    Institute for Computational Physics of the University of Stuttgart with
    <a href="https://www2.icp.uni-stuttgart.de/~icp/Christian_Holm"> Prof. Christian Holm</a>. 

    There his research focused on modeling of bacterial
    dynamics and biofilm lifecycle in confined geometries within the DFG
    collaborative research center <a href="https://www.sfb1313.uni-stuttgart.de"> SFB1313</a>.</p>
