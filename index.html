    <h2>Computational Physiology Research at Twente</h2>
    <p>Kartik Jain is an Assistant Professor of Biofluid Dynamics at the
    Engineering Fluid Dynamics group of the University of Twente. 
    Kartik obtained a Doctoral degree in Mechanical Engineering (Dr.-Ing.) with
    a distinction (summa cum laude) from the University of Siegen in Germany,
    prior to which he acquired his masters in Mechanical Engineering with a
    specialisation in Simulation Sciences from the RWTH Aachen University,
    Germany.
    His doctoral dissertation explored and characterized transition to
    turbulence in biofluid applications like blood flow in intracranial
    aneurysms and cerebrospinal fluid flow in the spinal canal. 
    Before moving to Europe, he acquired a Bachelor degree in Control
    Engineering from Kurukshetra University, India and then worked as a
    software developer in a leading IT company.
    </p>

    After completion of his PhD he spent two years as a Postdoc at the
    Institute of Physiology of the University of Z&uumlrich, Switzerland, where
    his research focused on computational modeling of renal hemodynamics and
    renal hypoxia within the Swiss national center of competence in research
    NCCR Kidney.CH.
    He thereafter returned to Germany to work as a senior scientist at the
    Institute for Computational Physics of the University of Stuttgart with
    Prof. Christian Holm.  There his research focused on modeling of bacterial
    dynamics and biofilm lifecycle in confined geometries within the DFG
    collaborative research center SFB1313.</p>
