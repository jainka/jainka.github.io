    <h3>The adaptable poly engineering simulator framework (APES)</h3>
      
      <img height=450 src="apes_schematic.svg">
    <br>
    The APES framework is developed and maintained at the <b> Chair for
    Simulation Techniques and Scientific Computing of the University of Siegen,
    Germany. </b>
    I have contributed to parts of the solver, especially the LBM solver <i> Musubi </i>.
    Components of the framework have been tested for scalability on all the
    major supercomputers (Tier-0) in Europe including the SuperMUC-NG,
    HazelHen, Juqueen as well as Piz Daint.

    <br>

    Most of the projects in my group use and develop one or more components of
    this framework and it forms the backbone of my research.
    Various members of APES are available as open sources packages that can be
    downloaded <a href="https://apes.osdn.io">here</a>.
