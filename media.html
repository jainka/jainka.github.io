    Vorticity magnitude across a bisecting plane in the FDA nozzle between 9th
    and 10th second of the simulation of throat Reynolds number 3500, computed
    from LBM simulations. 
    The mesh is discretized with about 2.8 billion lattice cells and
    simulations were executed on 304,128 cores of the SuperMUC-NG petascale
    system installed at the Leibniz Rechenzentrum in Garching, Germany.
    One thousand VTK files were written to disk by the APES framework, which
    were rendered using Paraview on the SuperMUC-NG.
