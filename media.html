    Vorticity magnitude across a bisecting plane in the FDA nozzle between 9th
    and 10th second of the simulation of throat Reynolds number 3500, computed
    from XR LBM simulations. One thousand VTK files were written to disk by the
    APES framework, which were rendered using Paraview on the SuperMUC-NG
