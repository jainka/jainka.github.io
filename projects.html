    <h3>Optical Coherence Tomography and High-Fidelity Flow Simulations for
    improved Stent Planning in Femoropopliteal Disease</h3>
    <p>
      In current endovascular practice for femoropopliteal disease, stent
      sizing and landing zones are typically based on a single-plane angiogram. 
      A combination with a pre-procedural CT angiography is preferred by some
      physicians.
      Stent sizing may therefore be suboptimal and minor lesions in the landing
      zone may be missed on the 2D imaging; two factors that have a detrimental
      effect on stent patency. 
      Current workflow could benefit from an optimization of lesion imaging
      during the procedure.
      Catheter-mounted optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a laser-based
      interference technique that, in one or several pullbacks, can produce a
      3D-geometry of the vessel wall with micrometer resolution.
      The introduction of intravascular OCT for peripheral arterial procedures
      can greatly improve procedural imaging of femoropopliteal lesions and
      therefore the planning of stent diameter, stent length and the optimal
      landing zones. 
      In addition, OCT can be used to better visualize the anatomical result
      after placement, compared to angiography.
      <br>
      Second, a high-resolution anatomic image obtained by OCT after stent
      placement can be used for fully resolved flow simulations using
      computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the Lattice Boltzmann method
      (LBM).
      The combination of best-in-class anatomic imaging with high-fidelity flow
      simulations offers a comprehensive approach to identify and understand
      pathophysiologic factors in stent planning that affect stent patency, and
      therefore to change endovascular practice.
      In this project with <b>Abbott Vascular</b>, we will investigate several
      of these research questions through CFD simulations on HPC systems.

    <h3>Understanding Liver Treatment to Improve Microsphere Optimal distribution (Ultimo)</h3>

    <p>
    Each year, around 1.5 million people worldwide develop liver tumours. 
    For a very small group of patients surgery can be performed while the
    remaining patients will be treated with systemic chemotherapy which give
    rise to a significant rate of adverse events and often provide a marginal
    increase in longevity.
    Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) is a globally used minimally
    invasive treatment modality which consists of injecting radioactive
    microspheres into the hepatic artery using a catheter.
    The idea is that it results in a high absorbed tumour doses while largely
    sparing the surrounding healthy liver tissue.
    However, a striking observation from post-treatment imaging studies,
    looking at microsphere distribution is that many tumours do not receive a
    lethal amount of radioactivity.
    This is also in line with high variety in patient outcome because of
    progressive disease and rarely observed cure of the patient.
    There are several parameters that possibly affect this distribution.
    Understanding the effects of these parameters is needed to optimize this
    local treatment.
    In this project we want to learn what these parameters are and set-up a
    planning system that can calculate the most optimal treatment approach
    resulting in an optimal patient outcome by more efficacy and less side
    effects.
