    <h3>Understanding Liver Treatment to Improve Microsphere Optimal distribution (Ultimo)</h3>

    Each year, around 1.5 million people worldwide develop liver tumours. 
    For a very small group of patients surgery can be performed while the
    remaining patients will be treated with systemic chemotherapy which give
    rise to a significant rate of adverse events and often provide a marginal
    increase in longevity.
    Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) is a globally used minimally
    invasive treatment modality which consists of injecting radioactive
    microspheres into the hepatic artery using a catheter.
    The idea is that it results in a high absorbed tumour doses while largely
    sparing the surrounding healthy liver tissue.
    However, a striking observation from post-treatment imaging studies,
    looking at microsphere distribution is that many tumours do not receive a
    lethal amount of radioactivity. 
    This is also in line with high variety in patient outcome because of
    progressive disease and rarely observed cure of the patient.
    There are several parameters that possibly affect this distribution.
    Understanding the effects of these parameters is needed to optimize this
    local treatment.
    In this project we want to learn what these parameters are and set-up a
    planning system that can calculate the most optimal treatment approach
    resulting in an optimal patient outcome by more efficacy and less side
    effects.
